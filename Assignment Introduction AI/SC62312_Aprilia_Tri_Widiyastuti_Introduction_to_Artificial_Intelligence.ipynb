To increase financial strength, apart from relying on salary, teachers can also increase their source of income by looking for additional work such as providing additional private lessons outside of lessons, opening a side business or other additional work.

No matter how much salary you receive, the most important thing is how to manage your salary wisely. Therefore, recording expenses and income and preparing a monthly budget is important in order to manage your salary wisely. To increase financial strength, apart from relying on salary, teachers can also increase their source of income by looking for additional work such as providing additional private lessons outside of lessons, opening a side business or other additional work. By having additional income, this can strengthen your financial condition and speed up efforts to achieve financial goals.\"]\n",
